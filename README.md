JavaScript Program Assignment Summary

This repository contains various JavaScript programs aimed at enhancing problem-solving skills using loops, if-else statements, and switch case constructs. The following topics are covered:

Loops:

Printing the first 10 natural numbers using a while loop.
Calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop.
Identifying even numbers between 1 and 50, calculating factorials, reversing numbers, and more.
Implementing the Fibonacci series and checking prime numbers.

If-Else Statements:

Finding the largest of three numbers.
Checking for leap years, vowel/consonant characters, and positive/negative numbers.
Assigning student grades based on marks, and checking for palindromes and divisibility by 3 and 7.

Switch Case:

Displaying the corresponding month for numbers 1â€“12.
Performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.
Providing grade descriptions (A to F) using a switch case.
These programs are designed to demonstrate key JavaScript concepts and logic structures, helping to improve understanding and implementation of conditional statements and loops.
